    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">1. Description of Services</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        These Terms and Conditions govern your use of BillWallet by Paymentus (“we,” “us,” and “our”) as a
        digital wallet and bill pay service (the “Paymentus BillWallet”). The Service allows you to store payment method
        information to pay a bill owed to a third-party biller (“Biller”). Any payment method, including but not limited
        to credit card, debit card, or bank account (“Payment Method”), you add to your digital wallet (“Wallet”) for
        purposes of paying a Biller and the account associated with your payment method will remain subject to the terms
        and conditions of all existing agreements with the financial institution issuing such debit card. Please review
        the terms of those agreements, as amended occasionally, as they contain important information about your rights
        and responsibilities when making transactions through the Wallet. Paymentus is not a bank or a money transfer
        company and provides no deposit account or other financial services. Paymentus neither transfers, nor stores
        funds, nor moves money. You may not establish a financial account with Paymentus of any kind. All money will be
        transmitted to a Biller by a third-party payment processor.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">2. Acceptance of Terms and Conditions</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions (the “Agreement”).
    </p>
    <p>
        We may amend this Agreement at any time. Your continued Service use will reflect your acceptance of the revised
        Terms and Conditions. Paymentus will provide notice if your rights under the Terms and Conditions change
        materially. If any change to the Terms and Conditions is unacceptable, discontinue using the Service
        immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">3. Privacy and Information Security</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We make security and the protection of your information a top priority. You can access our Privacy Policy
        through the Privacy Notice link in Bill Wallet adjacent to these Terms and Conditions, which is incorporated
        into and made a part of this Agreement by this reference. You agree that we will disclose information about your
        BillWallet transaction account and the payments to Billers:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>To complete transactions;</li>
        <li>In connection with offering the Service;</li>
        <li>In connection with the investigation of any claim related to your account or your payment instructions;</li>
        <li>To comply with government agency or court orders;</li>
        <li>By your written permission; or</li>
        <li>As otherwise permitted by the terms of our Privacy Policy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">4. Use of Personal Information to Identify You and Process
            Transfers</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        You authorize all applicable third-party payment processors to use the email address(es), telephone number(s),
        and other information that are associated with you as a protection measure to validate your identity and process
        and route payments from your BillWallet transaction account to the Billers you select.
    </p>
    <p>
        You agree that we may provide information about you to the Billers to whom you pay using BillWallet,
        the Billers’ financial institutions, or any other person who processes your payment, facilitates, or delivers
        transfers that you direct using BillWallet.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">5. Additional Provisions Concerning Use of Information</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        You agree that we may obtain such additional information as we deem reasonably necessary to ensure that you are
        not using the Service in violation of law, including, but not limited to, laws and regulations designed to
        prevent “money laundering” or the transfer of funds to or from persons or organizations whose accounts are
        blocked or sanctioned under rules of the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC),
        the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) of the United States Treasury Department, or other applicable
        regulator.
    </p>
    <p>
        To complete payments using the Service, we may need to communicate with other financial institutions and Billers
        concerning the transfer transactions. You agree that we may use, copy, modify, update, display, and distribute
        any information or data you provide for processing transfers or services to different financial institutions and
        Billers. You authorize us and third-party payment processors to use the information you provide and information
        concerning your transfers to initiate and complete transfers you initiate and provide ancillary and supporting
        services to facilitate your transfers and use of the Service. Your authorization includes but is not limited to,
        providing such information to Billers to whom you send funds using the Service, Billers’ Financial Institutions,
        and any intermediary or service that is in any way facilitating or processing the payment.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">6. Registering for the Service</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        You must provide us with an email address that you regularly use and intend to use regularly (i.e., no
        disposable email addresses) and a permanent mobile phone number that you intend to use for an extended period
        (i.e., no “burner” numbers). The reason for this is to ensure secure authorization.
    </p>
    <p>
        Suppose such registration occurs on the Biller’s website or other channels, such as automated phone service
        agent phone service, mobile app, or any other channels, during the registration. In that case, you also
        authorize us to get the email address, mobile number, or information such as your account number and applicable
        US zip code or Canadian postal code that may be necessary to authenticate you with a Biller. You further
        authorize us to use any information (except your Biller-specific authentication information relating to one
        Biller or one Biller payment flow) for other Billers to whom you may direct payments.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">7. Consent to Emails and Automated Text Messages</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        By registering and using the Service, you represent that you are the owner of the email address and mobile phone
        number or that you have the delegated legal authority to act on behalf of the owner of such email address and
        mobile phone number. You consent to receive emails or texts from Billers and us regarding the Services. You
        agree that our agents may use automatic telephone dialing systems in connection with text messages sent to any
        mobile phone number you register. You further acknowledge and agree:
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
        <li>You are responsible for any fees or other charges that your wireless carrier may charge for any related
            data, text, or other message services, including short message service (SMS). Please check your mobile
            service agreement for details or applicable fees.
        </li>
        <li>You will immediately notify us if any registered email address or mobile phone number is (i) surrendered or
            (ii) changed by you. You must notify us in writing of a change in your email address or mobile phone number.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">8. Disclosure of Liability</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>YOU AGREE THAT, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY
            COSTS, FEES, LOSSES, OR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND INCURRED BY YOU AS A RESULT OF (1) YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE; (2)
            OUR ACTIONS FOLLOWING YOUR PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS; (3) ANY INACCURACY, INCOMPLETENESS OR MISINFORMATION
            CONTAINED IN THE INFORMATION RETRIEVED ON THE ACCOUNTS; (4) ANY CHARGES IMPOSED, OR ACTIONS TAKEN, BY ANY
            INSTITUTION; (5) ANY FUNDS TRANSFER LIMITATIONS SET BY ANY INSTITUTION; AND (6) LIABILITY ARISING FROM THE
            RECEIPT OR NON-RECEIPT OF NOTIFICATIONS SENT TO BILLERS.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not transfer money. Accordingly, we shall have no liability to you for any money transfers, including,
        without limitation, (i) any failure, through no fault of us, to complete a transaction in the correct amount or
        (ii) any related losses or damages. We shall not be liable for any typos or keystroke errors you may make when
        using the Service.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR RESOLVING ANY PAYMENT OR OTHER DISPUTES YOU HAVE WITH ANY BILLER
            WHOM YOU SEND MONEY TO USING THE SERVICE.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">9. Limits</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>At any time, at our sole discretion, we reserve the right (and may be bound by law)</strong> to limit
        the amount(s) and number of payments you may send over a certain period. If you attempt to send payment(s) over
        these limits, such payment(s) may be rejected. If you are permitted to send payment(s) over these limits, such
        payment shall be subject to this Agreement, and we are not obligated to accept similar payment(s) in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">10. Contact in the Event of Unauthorized Transfer</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you believe someone has transferred or may transfer money using your BillWallet Service without
        your permission, call us immediately at <strong>1-800-420-1663</strong> or email us at <strong>customercare@paymentus.com</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">11. Failure or Rejection of Transfers; Refused Payments</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We communicate transfer instructions but do not transfer money. Financial institutions and payment service
        providers affect transfers. Accordingly, we do not make any representation or warranty that any transfer can be
        completed or that it can be completed within a particular timeframe. Any estimates we may provide concerning the
        completion date for the transfer are only estimates and are not binding on us. You understand and agree that we
        have no control over the actions of Billers, payment service processors, or financial institutions that may
        prevent or delay a transfer.
    </p>
    <p>
        We reserve the right to decline, initiate, or complete a transfer for any reason. We reserve the right to refuse
        to pay any Biller.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">12. Disclaimer of Warranties</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED HEREIN AND SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAW, WE MAKE NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
        REPRESENTATIONS, OR ENDORSEMENTS WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICE. WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF
        ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
        MERCHANTABILITY, MERCHANTABLE QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, WITH REGARD
        TO THE SERVICE DESCRIBED OR PROVIDED. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE,
        OR ERROR-FREE OR THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”
        BASIS.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">13. Limitation of Liability</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED HEREIN AND SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL WE AND OUR RESPECTIVE
        OWNERS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, AGENTS, OR PAYMENT PROCESSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, BUT
        NOT LIMITED TO, ANY DIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR OTHER INDIRECT DAMAGES ARISING OUT
        OF (I) ANY TRANSACTION CONDUCTED THROUGH OR FACILITATED BY THE SERVICE; (II) ANY CLAIM ATTRIBUTABLE TO ERRORS,

        SERVICE OR WITH THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USING THE SERVICE.
    </p>
    <p>
        IN THOSE US STATES OR JURISDICTIONS IN CANADA WHERE THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL
        OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES MAY NOT APPLY, ANY LIABILITY OF US OR OUR RESPECTIVE OWNERS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND
        AGENTS IN THOSE US STATES OR JURISDICTIONS IN CANADA IS LIMITED. WARRANTIES ARE EXCLUDED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT
        PERMITTED BY LAW BUT SHALL, IN NO EVENT, EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100.00).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">14. Indemnification</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        You acknowledge and agree that you are personally responsible for your conduct while using the Service. Except
        as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless us, applicable
        third-party payment processors, and our respective owners, directors, officers, and agents from and against all
        claims, losses, expenses, damages, and costs (including, but not limited to, direct, incidental, consequential,
        exemplary and indirect damages), and reasonable legal fees, resulting from or arising out of your use, misuse,
        errors, or inability to use the Service, or any violation by you of the terms of this Agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">15. Governing Law; Jurisdiction</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        This Agreement will be governed by and construed under the laws of Delaware in the United States of America or
        the Province in which you reside in Canada. Using the Service, you submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
        courts within Delaware if you are within the United States and, in Canada, within that Province and waive any
        jurisdictional venue or inconvenient forum objections to such courts. You further agree to comply with
        applicable federal, state, provincial, and local laws of the country of residence when using the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will not be deemed to have waived any of our rights or remedies under this Agreement unless such waiver is in
        writing and signed by us. No delay or omission on our part in exercising any rights or remedies shall operate as
        a waiver of such rights or remedies or any other rights or remedies. A waiver on any one occasion shall not be
        construed as a bar or waiver of any rights or remedies on future occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">16. Complete Agreement; Severability</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        You agree that this Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between us, sets forth
        the entire understanding between you and us concerning the Service, and supersedes any proposal or prior
        agreement, oral or written, and any other communications between us. Nothing in any advertising material you may
        view or have viewed varies from this Agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
        If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck, and the
        remaining provisions shall be enforced. The captions of sections hereof are for convenience only and shall not
        control or affect the meaning or construction of any of the provisions of this Agreement. If there is a conflict
        between the terms of this Agreement and something stated by an employee or contractor of ours (including but not
        limited to customer care personnel), the terms of the Agreement will prevail.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">17. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
