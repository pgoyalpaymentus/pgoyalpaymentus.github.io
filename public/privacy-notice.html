    </p>
    <p>
        We collect information, including Personal Data, to provide better services to all our users and, in the case of
        information we collect from individuals connected with our commercial customers or prospects for marketing
        purposes. We use “Personal Data” to refer to any information that identifies, relates to, or describes an
        identifiable natural person. Common examples of Personal Data include name, email address, phone number, digital
        identity, login name or handle, information about your device, and specific metadata.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Sensitive Personal Data” refers to a smaller subset of Personal Data considered more sensitive to the
        individual, such as financial information, health, race and ethnic origin.
    </p>
    <p>
        We obtain Personal Data directly from customers and Biller agents who use our Services and directly and
        indirectly from activity on our Services.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong id="Info_Collect_Customers" role="heading" aria-level="2">Information We Collect about our
            Customers</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Personal Data we collect includes, but is not limited to, the following circumstances and data elements:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Directly from our services' consumers.
        </li>
        <li>
            From third parties, such as payment processors and facilitators, that interact with us in connection with
            the services we perform and from data providers to help us identify contacts within commercial prospects and
            billers.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you express an interest in obtaining additional information about our Services, request customer support,
            use our “Contact Us” or similar features on any Sites and Services, or download certain content, we may
            require that you provide us with your personal identifiers and contact information, such as your name,
            address, phone number, or email address to respond to you;
        </li>
        <li>
            Directly from our customers or their agents or service providers. For example, from documents and electronic
            files that our customers provide related to the services they engage us.
        </li>
        <li>
            Indirectly from our customers or their agents or service providers. For example, we can use the information
            we collect from our customers while providing services to them.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If you register to and use our Sites or Services, including to pay bills, we will require that you or
                your Biller provide your personal identifiers (such as your name and username), password, contact
                information (such as your address, U.S. zip code or Canadian postal code, phone number, or email
                address), financial and billing information (such as billing name and address, account number, credit or
                debit card number or bank account information), other documents (such as PDFs of your billing
                statements), details from the bill and bill payment history, as well as information necessary to verify
                your identity, including personal identifiers (such as your name). Some of this information may be
                considered “sensitive” Personal Data under applicable privacy laws of Canada or provinces of Canada.</p>
            <p>When you provide account information, Paymentus uses it to complete the requested task or as otherwise
                provided in this Privacy Notice.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Directly and indirectly from activity on our Sites (www.paymentus.com and www.finovera.com) or sites we
            maintain for our customers, such as website usage details collected automatically. In addition, like many
            companies, we use “cookies,” which are small text files a website can use to recognize users who return,
            facilitate the user’s ongoing access to and use of the site, and track usage behavior of, for example, the
            webpages you visit.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you use the IVR part of the Services, we may request voice consent to confirm payment authorization, and
            as a result, we may collect and retain audio information (such as audio recordings through our interactive
            voice response system);
        </li>
        <li>
            When you use and interact with Sites and Services, mobile apps, or emails, we automatically collect
            information about your device and your usage of Sites and Services or emails through cookies, web beacons,
            or similar technologies, including Internet or other electronic network activity information (such as
            Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, log files, or other identifiers) to monitor performance and accuracy of
            our technology. Please see the <a href="#Cookies_Tech">Cookies &amp; Similar Technologies</a> section for
            more details.
        </li>
        <li>
            We can also access data from your connection within social media platforms and networks connected to our
            Sites, such as LinkedIn.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you voluntarily submit certain information to Sites and Services, such as by filling out a survey about
            your user experience or participating in promotional activities, we collect the information you provide as
            part of that request.
        </li>
        <li>
            If a Biller requires an authentication token, we may collect your personal identifiers (such as your Social
            Insurance Number, date of birth, or driver’s licence); this information may be considered “sensitive”
            Personal Data under specific privacy laws; we will only use this information for authentication purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
            BILLWALLET - We also collect Biller-specific information, such as your account number and other information,
            to identify you with the Biller to which you are directing a payment. For example, your utility billing
            account number with your utility, policy number with your insurance company, or the telephone number with
            your telephone company, etc. All these pieces of information establish your identity with BillWallet or your
            Biller. Unless only related to a particular Biller, the information collected will help authenticate you and
            make payments to others you choose to set up.
        </li>
        <li>
            LOAN—If you apply for a loan through Sites and Services, we may require that you provide your personal
            identifiers (such as your name), contact information (such as your address, U.S. zip code or Canadian postal
            code, State or Province, phone number, or email address), and other data.
        </li>

        relating to your Personal Data, please use the information set out in the <a href="#Contact_Us">How to Contact

        <strong id="Failure_Personal" role="heading" aria-level="2">8. When You Choose Not to Provide Personal
            Data</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Paymentus requires the provision of your Personal Data to use certain parts of our Services and programs. If you
        choose not to provide such Personal Data, you may be unable to access and use our Services or our programs or
        parts of our Services or our programs. Paymentus may use required fields to guarantee the required amount of
        necessary data and ensure the quality of data collected. We may use auto-complete fields to minimize the risk of
        inaccurate data.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong id="Retention_Personal" role="heading" aria-level="2">9. Our Retention of Your Personal Data</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data based on applicable regulatory requirements, the
        amount, nature, and sensitivity of your Personal Data processed, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized
        use or disclosure of your Personal Data, and whether we can achieve the purposes of the processing through other
        means, as well as based on applicable legal requirements (such as applicable statutes of limitation). We try to
        collect only the minimum data needed for each purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
        After the applicable retention periods expire, Paymentus will delete your data. If any data we cannot delete
        entirely from our systems for technical reasons remains, we will implement appropriate measures to prevent
        further use of such data.

        <strong id="Sharing_Personal" role="heading" aria-level="2">10. Sharing Personal Data</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Paymentus may disclose any of the categories of Personal Data listed above for our business and commercial
        purposes as described below.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Service providers and affiliates</span>. We disclose Personal
                Data to your Billers (our Paymentus Partners), our service providers, affiliates, and trusted business
                partners. This enables our compliance with applicable laws and payment network rules when you make a
                payment or register access to your accounts. This allows us to process your payment instructions or to
                test or improve our Services. When we disclose Personal Data for these reasons, we enter into a contract
                that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that Personal Data confidential and
                not use it for any purpose except for the purposes outlined in the contract. We enforce compliance by
                the recipients with the privacy protection requirements of those contracts.

        We use Paymentus Partner Information to support the Paymentus Partner account, maintain our business
        relationship with the Paymentus Partner, respond to Paymentus Partner inquiries, or perform accounting
        functions. Paymentus Partners may update their personal information and password by logging into the Paymentus
        Platform and updating their account. Paymentus Partners may contact Paymentus support to delete their personal
        data. In some cases, we may be unable to delete Paymentus Partner Information.

        If you schedule a demo, we may ask you to provide personal identifiers such as a phone number and email to

        with your utility, policy number with your insurance company, or the telephone number with your telephone
        company, etc. All these pieces of information are used to establish your identity with BillWallet or your
        Biller. The information collected, unless only related to Biller, will help you authenticate and make payments

        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2"><i>Rights Specific to California Residents</i></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Under the CCPA, a California resident has the following rights: (1) to request additional information about our
        data collection, use, disclosure, and sales practices in connection with your Personal Data; (2) to request the
        specific Personal Data collected about you during the previous 12 months; (3) to request the deletion of the
        Personal Data we have about you; (4) to request a restriction on specific processing of Personal Data; and (5)
        to request correction of inaccurate information. Paymentus will not discriminate against You for exercising your
        California privacy rights. You may submit a request to exercise your rights under the CCPA through one of two
        means:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Submit a request via email to <a href="mailto:privacy@paymentus.com">privacy@paymentus.com</a>, or
        </li>
        <li>
            Call (800) 420-1663 to submit your request.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Paymentus will confirm receipt of your request by email, or if you utilize our customer portal, we may do so by
        sending a message to you in the portal. To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we may take steps to
        verify your identity before granting you access to the information. In some instances, such as a request to
        delete Personal Data, we may first separately confirm that you would like for us to delete your Personal Data
        before acting on your request.
    </p>
    <p>
        We aim to respond to your request as soon as reasonably practicable and consistent with applicable laws. We will
        inform you of the reason and extension period in writing if we require more time. We will deliver our written
        response by mail or electronically, at your option. You may authorize another individual or a business
        registered with the California Secretary of State, called an authorized agent, to make requests on your behalf
        through these means. We may have a reason under the law why we do not have to comply with your request or why we
        may comply with it in a more limited way than you anticipated. If we do, we will explain that to you in our
        response.
    </p>
    <p>
        California residents are also entitled to contact us to request information about whether we have disclosed
        Personal Data to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Under California's “Shine the
        Light” law, California residents may opt out of our disclosure of Personal Data to third parties for their
        direct marketing purposes. You may opt out of sharing your Personal Data with third parties for marketing
        purposes. To make such a request, you should send (a) an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@paymentus.com">privacy@paymentus.com</a>
        with the subject heading “California Privacy Rights” or (b) a letter to us at the address listed in the <a
            href="#Contact_Us">“How to Contact Us.”</a> In your request, please attest that you are a California
        resident and provide a current California address for our response. California provided specific privacy rights
        regarding information sharing. We reserve the right not to respond to requests submitted to addresses other than
        those specified in this paragraph.
