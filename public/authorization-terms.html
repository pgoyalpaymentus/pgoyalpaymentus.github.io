        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">1. Paymentus Corporation</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Welcome to the secure bill payment technology service (“Paymentus Technology Platform”) provided by <strong>PAYMENTUS
        CORPORATION</strong> ("Paymentus," "we," "our," or "us"). We are an authorized provider for the company
        ("Biller") to whom you will pay. Any individual or entity (“users,” “you,” or “your”) accept these terms and
        conditions if you use this service (the “Services”) to make this and any future payment. Please read them
        carefully. You should retain an electronic or printed copy of these terms.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">2. Refund Policy</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Under normal circumstances, there are no payment refunds. Paymentus does not handle your money. Our Services are
        limited to transmitting payment instructions on your behalf to pay your Billers.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">3. Privacy Policy</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Paymentus secures and uses your information to process payment transactions as provided in our <a
            href="privacy-notice.html">Paymentus Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">4. Other Payment Options</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        You understand that your Biller has provided other ways to pay your bill, such as by mail or, in some cases, in
        person, that may be less costly than our Services and that using our Service is voluntary and offered as a
        convenience to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your biller has decided to offset all or any portion of the cost of acceptance paid by the biller for processing
        a transaction by charging you a fee for the services (“Fee for Services”). The Biller is responsible for any Fee
        for Services being charged as the merchant and ensuring the charge complies with all card network rules
        applicable to merchants and the payment fee type. Further, the Biller is responsible for ensuring the Fee for
        Service otherwise complies with all applicable laws, including, without limitation, whether to charge you a Fee
        for Service, the amount of any Fee for a Service charged to you, any disclosure requirements, the application of
        any rate caps, any regulatory prohibitions or restrictions applicable to the Fee for Service, and any industry
        restrictions or requirements applicable to the Biller, including whether there are any payment restrictions in
        the terms and conditions of any agreement the Biller has with you or with third parties, or any licensing
        requirements. If you have questions or concerns regarding the amount of the Fee for Services charged to you and
        whether the Biller retains any portion of that fee, please contact your Biller.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">5. No Collection Activities by Paymentus</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        You represent that your payment is not in response to any debt collection activities started by Paymentus and
        that Paymentus has not acted as a vendor, seller, merchant, collector, or lessor concerning any goods or
        services you received from your Biller. If you think that we have conducted debt collection activities
        concerning your account, you agree to discontinue your payment transaction through us immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
        You acknowledge and agree that Paymentus is not a debt collector, is not acting as a debt collector on behalf of
        your Biller, has not identified itself as a debt collector, and has not asked you to make a payment or has
        otherwise engaged with your relationship with the Biller. You acknowledge that Paymentus has made services
        available for your use, at your sole discretion, on the Paymentus Technology Platform to enable you to pay the
        money you owe to the biller more conveniently. If you think that we have conducted debt collection activities
        concerning your account, you agree to discontinue your payment transaction through us immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">6. Text and Pre-recorded Messages</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        By agreeing to these terms, you consent that Paymentus and your Biller may call or text you, including but not
        limited to, at any number you provide to Paymentus or your Biller, for any purpose, including to provide
        information relating to your account with and services provided by your Biller. You consent to Paymentus or your
        Biller placing these calls or texts using, among other methods, an automatic telephone dialing system or an
        artificial or pre-recorded voice. Message and data rates may apply. You agree that to withdraw your consent for
        these messages, you must notify your Biller at the number your Biller provides for customer service ("Customer
        Service Number") for specific instructions, depending on your situation. If you withdraw your consent, you may
        be unable to use specific Paymentus payment channels or services.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">7. Authorization</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        For ACH payments in the United States and Interac® payments in Canada, by clicking on the designated button to
        complete a payment or otherwise authorizing a payment, you authorize Paymentus to send instructions to initiate
        a one-time or recurring ACH debit in the United States (“U.S.”) or a pre-authorized debit (“PAD”) in Canada to
        the bank account you indicated in the amount of the "Payment Amount" (charged directly by your Biller).
    </p>
    <p>
        If a "Fee for Service or “Service Fee” is listed, you also authorize a one-time or recurring ACH debit in the
        U.S. or a PAD in Canada in the amount Paymentus charges for using it's the Paymentus Technology Platform. You
        understand that because this is an electronic transaction, these funds may be withdrawn from your bank account
        as soon as today unless you have specified a later date.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have specified a later date for your ACH in the U.S. or PAD in Canada payment and wish to cancel it (up
        to 24 hours prior), you can call your Biller at its designated Customer Service Number.
    </p>
    <p>
        For credit card payments, by clicking on the designated button to complete a payment or otherwise authorizing a
        payment, you agree to pay the amount indicated as the full amount of each payment ("Total Amount Charged")
        according to the card issuer agreement governing the card whose details you have provided. All authorizations
        are subject to the agreements governing your card. Payment transactions by card will only be completed after
        receiving successful approval from your card company for the Total Amount Charged.
    </p>
    <p>
        You usually see one line item on your card or bank statement – the Total Amount Charged. That amount will
        include the Service Fee (if one is charged), which is disclosed to you before you pay. In some cases, you may
        see two line items: one for the Payment Amount and the other for the Fee for Services or Service Fee.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">8. Saving Payment Information</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        By selecting the “Make a Payment,” “Pay Now,” or “Pay” button, you represent and warrant that you are legally
        authorized to pay your Biller using the account or card you designated. If you save your payment information for
        future use, it will be used at your request to make future payments to your Biller for as long as this
        information is retained. If we make any changes to these terms and conditions that affect the use of the saved
        information, we will post the new terms on our website or provide them to you by email.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">9. ARBITRATION – in the United States</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS REGARDING ARBITRATION APPLY ONLY TO CLAIMS BETWEEN PAYMENTUS AND UNITED STATES
            INDIVIDUALS.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN US AND AN INDIVIDUAL (FOR THIS PURPOSE, A HUMAN BEING) ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THE
            USE OF OUR SERVICES OR A PAYMENT TO A BILLER OR OTHER CUSTOMER OF OURS ("DISPUTE") WILL BE RESOLVED BY
            MANDATORY AND BINDING ARBITRATION ADMINISTERED BY NATIONAL ARBITRATION AND MEDIATION ("NAM") UNDER ITS
            COMPREHENSIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION RULES AND PROCEDURES ("RULES"). NO DISPUTE MAY BE PURSUED ON A CLASS OR
            OTHER REPRESENTATIVE BASIS, AND NEITHER PARTY WILL SEEK TO COORDINATE OR CONSOLIDATE ANY ARBITRATION WITH
            ANY OTHER PROCEEDING BY THE OTHER. THE ARBITRATOR WILL FOLLOW APPLICABLE SUBSTANTIVE LAW AND HAS NO
            AUTHORITY TO DEVIATE FROM THAT LAW. UNLESS PROHIBITED BY LAW, THE ARBITRATOR WILL DECIDE WHAT IS SUBJECT TO
            ARBITRATION. THIS AGREEMENT IS GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT, 9 U.S.C. § 1 ET SEQ., AND ANY AWARD
            SHALL BE FINAL AND BINDING AND MAY BE ENTERED AS JUDGMENT IN ANY COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION. IN THE
            EVENT NAM IS UNWILLING OR UNAVAILABLE TO ACT AS ARBITRATOR, THE PARTIES OR A COURT WILL SELECT ANOTHER
            ARBITRATOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT. A COPY OF THE RULES ARE AVAILABLE FROM ITS
            WEBSITE <a href="WWW.NAMADR.COM">WWW.NAMADR.COM</a>. IF ANY PART OF THIS PARAGRAPH IS DETERMINED TO BE
            INVALID, THE REMINDER WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT.

    </p>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">10. Limitation of Liability</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        You agree that except as otherwise provided by law, our liability for any delay, delivery failure, underpayment,
        or nonpayment is limited to the Fee for Service paid to Paymentus to process your transaction. In no event shall
        Paymentus be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages. You agree further
        that Paymentus shall not be liable for any damages for its failure to process transactions from prohibited third
        parties or which violate Paymentus’ s program rules, these terms, and any applicable laws or network rules.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">11. PROHIBITED USE</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            PAYMENTUS DOES NOT PROCESS INSTRUCTIONS FOR PAYMENTS FROM THIRD PARTY PAYERS WITHOUT THE PRIOR EXPRESS,
            AUTHORIZED WRITTEN CONSENT OF PAYMENTUS. THE PAYMENTUS TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM SHALL ONLY BE USED BY PAYMENTUS
            BILLERS ’ CUSTOMERS. THIRD PARTY COMMERCIAL PAYERS AND/OR PAYMENT AGGREGATORS ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM
            PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS FOR PAYMENTS THROUGH THE PAYMENTUS TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM OR OTHERWISE USING THE
            PAYMENTUS TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM WHETHER WEB-BASED, IVR, OR CSR INTERFACES WITHOUT THE PRIOR, EXPRESS,
            AUTHORIZED WRITTEN CONSENT OF PAYMENTUS. BY USING THE PAYMENTUS TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM, YOU REPRESENT AND
            WARRANT YOU ("PAYER") ARE (I) A CUSTOMER OF A PAYMENTUS BILLER; (II) PAYING A BILL ON YOUR BEHALF OR AS AN
            EMPLOYEE OR RELATIVE OF A PAYER; AND (III) NOT USING THE PAYMENTUS TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM AND/OR THE ELECTRONIC
            BILLING AND PAYMENT SERVICES ON BEHALF OF A PAYER UNDER A CLAIM OF AGENCY OR OTHER THIRD-PARTY RELATIONSHIP,
            OR FOR COMMERCIAL GAIN (WITHOUT THE PRIOR, EXPRESS, AUTHORIZED WRITTEN CONSENT OF PAYMENTUS). YOU AGREE THAT
            ANY BREACH OF THESE WARRANTIES CONSTITUTES A MATERIAL BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT. PAYMENTUS RESERVES THE RIGHT
            TO REVERSE OR CANCEL, INCLUDING RETROACTIVELY, ANY AND ALL INSTRUCTIONS FOR PAYMENTS MADE FROM UNAPPROVED
            THIRD-PARTY AGENCIES. YOU AGREE TO (I) INDEMNIFY PAYMENTUS FOR INTERCHANGE FEES, MERCHANT FEES, AS WELL AS

            BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">12. Compliance with Law</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Each time you make a payment, you represent and warrant that your use of the Paymentus Technology Platform shall
        not violate any law, statute, or regulation involving money laundering or any other illegal activity. The
        Paymentus Technology Platform — including, but not limited to, websites, IVR systems, and CSR interfaces —
        belongs to Paymentus. Paymentus owns all intellectual property contained in those platforms. You further agree
        that you will utilize the platform solely for the payment amounts owed to the Biller and will not use or
        introduce to the Paymentus Technology Platform any automated program, automated payment paradigm, or device such
        as a robot, spider, or scraper for any reason, including, without limitation, to pay bills, copy the platform or
        otherwise obtaining information about the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">13. Governing Law</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Except to the extent limited or required by federal law, the laws of the State of Delaware in the United States
        or the province of Canada in which you reside, without regard to principles of conflicts of law, will govern the
        interpretation of these terms and conditions and any claim or dispute between you and Paymentus.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">14. Changes to Terms and Conditions</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We may modify these terms and conditions occasionally for various reasons, including to reflect changes to our
        Services, changes to the law, or other business reasons. We will post changes or revised terms and conditions
        here, and you should regularly refer to this page. In most cases, changes will only take effect ten (10) days
        after they have been posted. Exceptions include when new services or functionality are added or changes made for
        legal reasons, which will be effective immediately. You should stop using our Services if you disagree with new
        or modified terms.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">15. If using the Customer Portal or Customer Service Call Centers for
            payments</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        By providing us with the requested information and submitting it to us, you authorize us, on behalf of your
        Biller, to issue electronic debits (i.e., eChecks (US) or PADs (Canada)) to your bank or to charge your debit or
        credit card (depending on the information you have given us) either for a one-time payment or on the schedule
        you agree to when setting up a payment schedule. This provides us with the right to present a check (US) or PAD
        (Canada) to your bank or to charge your debit or credit card (each a "transfer") for your bill payment and any
        Fee for Service (if one is charged), as you have instructed us for a one-time payment or as scheduled. You are
        responsible for having funds available in your account when the eCheck or PAD is processed by your financial
        institution or when your debit card is charged.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may use our Services to pay your Biller from your checking or savings account or charge it to your credit or
        debit card, in the amounts and on the days or schedule your request. If applicable, the maximum payment you may
        make will be disclosed when you authorize or schedule your payment. Each payment will include the Fee for
        Service (if one is charged) in the amount disclosed before you submit your one-time payment authorization or
        payment schedule. The Fee for Service may be a separate payment on your bank or card statement. If any payment
        date falls on a weekend or holiday, that payment may be executed on the next business day. This authorization
        will remain in effect until you cancel it using the same method you used to authorize a one-time payment or
        create the schedule by calling the Customer Service Number. The cancellation request must be received at least
        three (3) business days before the next payment date for a scheduled payment. The cancellation request must be
        received at least 24 hours before the scheduled payment date for a future-dated one-time payment. However, if
        you submit a payment request after you cancel the authorization, you will be deemed to have re-instated this
        authorization. A "business day" is Monday through Friday, except for holidays.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>
            <u>CANADIAN USER NOTE:</u> Cancelling your PAD doesn’t cancel your contract with your Biller and doesn’t
            cancel any amount you owe. By canceling your PAD, you are simply informing the Biller that you wish to
            change your payment method. You’ll need to arrange to pay any amounts you owe with the Biller.

            (Canada)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            ADDITIONAL TERMS THAT APPLY ONLY TO PADs AND INTERAC® TRANSFERS (CANADA) AND CHECKS OR DEBIT CARD TRANSFERS
            (US) BY THE RESPECTIVE RESIDENTS FROM ACCOUNTS USED PRIMARILY FOR PERSONAL, FAMILY, OR HOUSEHOLD PURPOSES
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">17. Scheduled Payments</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you set up scheduled payments, you will receive advance written notice from your Biller if a transfer varies
        in amount from the previous transfer. This notice may be your monthly bill or a separate notice and will include
        the amount and the date of the following transfer, which, unless otherwise stated, will be the due date of the
        bill.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">18. Stop Payment</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you order your Biller to stop a payment three (3) business days or more before the transfer is scheduled, and
        your Biller does not, you may request your bank to recover the payment.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">19. Disclaimer of Liability</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        According to our agreement, we will not be liable for more than our Fee for Service if we do not complete a
        transfer from your account on time or in the correct amount. In addition, we will not be liable:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>If, through no fault of ours, you do not have enough money in your account to make the transfer</li>
        <li>If the transfer goes over the credit limit on your overdraft line</li>
        <li>If the means you used to access our Services were not working properly</li>
        <li>If circumstances beyond our control (such as fire or flood) prevent the transfer despite reasonable
            precautions that we have taken
        </li>
        <li>Other exceptions stated in your agreement with your Biller</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">20. Confidentiality</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Confidentiality is critical to us. We will disclose information about the transfers you make or authorize to
        your biller. In addition, we will disclose information to third parties:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Where it is necessary to complete transfers</li>
        <li>To verify the existence and condition of your account for a third party, such as a credit bureau or
            merchant
        </li>
        <li>To comply with government agency or court orders</li>
        <li>As provided in our <a href="privacy-notice.html">Paymentus Privacy Policy</a> or the privacy policy of your
            Biller or
        </li>
        <li>If you give us your written permission.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">21. Lost or Stolen Data Liability</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Your Biller performs customer care functions related to your accounts with your Biller. If you believe your
        username and password to the Customer Portal have been lost or stolen, call the Customer Service Number and
        change your password immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>In Canada</strong>, if you use a credit card to effect payment to your Biller using our Services, then
        according to Section 12 of the Cost of Borrowing Regulations under the Bank Act (Canada), the maximum liability
        for unauthorized use of a credit card issued by a federal regulated financial institution is $50 if you are
        found liable for a transaction, but
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You must tell your Biller as soon as you learn of the loss or theft, and</li>
        <li>You must have used reasonable care to safeguard your credentials.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>In the US</strong>, if you tell your Biller within four (4) business days of discovering loss or theft,
        you can lose no more than $50 if someone uses your credentials to authorize a transfer without your permission,
        provided you have used reasonable care in safeguarding your credentials.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you do <u>not</u> tell your biller within four (4) business days after discovering the loss or theft, and we
        can prove we could have stopped someone from authorizing a transfer without your permission if you had told your
        biller, you could lose as much as $500.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong role="heading" aria-level="2">22. Errors &amp; Unauthorized Transfers</strong>
    </p>

        <strong>In Canada</strong>, tell your Biller immediately if your bank statement shows transfers you did not make

    <p>
        <strong>In the U.S.</strong>, tell your Biller immediately if your bank statement shows transfers you did not
        make or authorize. If you do <u>not</u> tell your biller within 90 days after the statement was mailed to you,
        you may not get back any money you lost after the 90 days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone
        from taking the money if you had told your biller in time. If a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital
        stay) keeps you from telling your biller, the periods will be extended.
    </p>
    <p>
        ALL QUESTIONS ABOUT TRANSACTIONS MADE THROUGH OUR SERVICES MUST BE DIRECTED TO YOUR BILLER AND NOT TO THE BANK
        OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WHERE YOU HAVE YOUR ACCOUNT.

        soon as you can if you think there is any error about a bill payment through our Services that appears in your
        bank statement, Biller account information, information available through our system, or receipt or if you need
        more information about a bill payment through our system.
    </p>
    <p>

        writing within a certain number of days.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your Biller will work with us to determine whether an error occurred and will correct any error promptly.

        question.

        documents used in the investigation.

    <p>
        However, if we or your Biller need more time, <u>we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint</u> or
        question. If we decide to do this, <u>we may credit your account within ten (10) business days for the amount
        you think is in error</u> so that you will have the use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our
        investigation. If we or your biller ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive
        it within ten (10) business days, we may not credit your account.
